  <p><u>Have you ever talked with those who have British accents ?</u>
  Yes, I have, yesterday. The moment I first talked with her, I felt so frustrated.
  She was sure to have talked to me in English, But It was hard to understand because of her accent.
  I'd never talked with someone who has an English accent before but, I already know how difficult it is.
  But, the situation was so much harder than I thought.

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">It is true that It is confusing to understand other country's accents even those who have learned English for ages.
  When I was talking with her, I got the feeling that I should change the country where I am going to go.
  But now, I decide to start watching British TV shows to improve my listening.
  I guess I have to do better and more than what I studied.</p>
